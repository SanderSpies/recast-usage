Recast
============
Nothing to see here, move along.

Although recast is pretty awesome, I'm missing some features to do more advances operations on the AST. Recast-usage is my attempt to implement this.  

Todo
---
- [x] Build declaration tree
- [ ] The rest

Goal
---
- Add usage information to recast
- Add operations that use this usage information, most importantly:
  - Take out an entire function and everything that is related to it
